Wander is an Arweave and AO native wallet that provides non-custodial wallet and asset management. Wander allows wallet holders to interact with any Arweave or AO dApps securely, without sharing their private keys with the dApp.&#x20;

The isolated environment that Wander creates is not only a security improvement for users, but it also provides a more seamless login flow for applications. Developers no longer have to build sign in functionality, they can let Wander do the hard work for them.

There are three products which work together but have different use cases depending on the experience developers want to provide to their users:

* _Wander Connect_ - An embedded wallet that will take the friction out of onboarding by offering multiple authentication options (SSO, Passkey, etc) via a very simple SDK.  Zero downloads or zero installs needed for end users.  Wander Connect will also be able to be customized and white-labeled to give your dApps a smoother UX experience.  [Get started with Wander Connect.](https://docs.wander.app/wander-connect/intro)
* _Wander Browser Extension_ - A traditional web3 wallet experience and the OG Wander product.  For the more experienced Web3 user, the browser extension gives users and developers the classic web3 experience for their dApps.  Users can generate a wallet without needing to provide an email.  [Get started with the Wander Browser Extension](https://docs.wander.app/api/intro). &#x20;
* _Wander Mobile App_ - Similar to the Wander Browser Extension, the Wander Mobile App (and Wander Connect) is for developers that have a mobile first focus for their dApp.  Like the browser extension, users can generate a wallet without needing to provide an email and easily access any AO dApp directly from the mobile app.  [Get started with the Wander Mobile App](https://docs.wander.app/api/intro).

_Note: By integrating the Wander Injected API, your dApp will have support for the Wander Browser Extension and Wander Mobile App_
