# Events

Wander provides useful custom events to track the state of the extension. These events implement the [`CustomEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events#adding_custom_data_%E2%80%93_customevent) browser API.

## `arweaveWalletLoaded` event

This event is dispatched once the Wander Injected API has been initialized in the `window` object. Before this event is fired, you cannot interact with Wander and the `window.arweaveWallet` object will be undefined.

### Example

```ts
addEventListener("arweaveWalletLoaded", (e) => {
  const { permissions } = e.detail;

  if (permissions === 0) {
    await window.arweaveWallet.connect(["ACCESS_ADDRESS"]);
  } else {
    // We can already interact with the wallet...
  }
});
```

## `walletSwitch` event

This event is fired when the user manually switches their active wallet. The even also includes the new active wallet's address, if the user allowed the `ACCESS_ADDRESS` and the `ACCESS_ALL_ADDRESSES` permissions.

### Example

```ts
addEventListener("walletSwitch", (e) => {
  const { address } = e.detail;

  // Handle wallet switch...
});
```

## Event emitter

The event emitter is available under `window.arweaveWallet.events` as a more advanced event system for the extension.
