# Subsidizing Arweave/AO payments

You can subsidize payments in Arweave/AO using a bundler.

While it is outside the scope of these docs, you should know you can either run your own bundler, 
or use a commercial option like [ArDrive's Turbo](https://docs.ardrive.io/docs/turbo/what-is-turbo.html).

You can find more about [Turbo Credit Sharing here](https://docs.ardrive.io/docs/turbo/what-is-turbo.html).
