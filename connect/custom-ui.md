# Wander Connect with Custom UI

If the [Advanced Customization Options](connect/advanced-customization.md) provided by the Wander Connect SDK are not

[SDK methods](connect/methods.md) to open/closing the wallet without relaying on the default injected button.

## Providing a custom `iframe`

## Disabling the default injected `button`
